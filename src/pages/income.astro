                <Text as="p">The middle income trap simply refers to a situation where a country can become stuck,
                    financially, at a certain level. This happens because more jobs are created within a country and
                    then
                    more people move to the area for these jobs. Unfortunately, the conditions of the jobs, along with
                    training and pay, become stagnant and they do not grow any longer. This becomes an issue because
                    inflation then drives up the cost of living due to all of the additional growth, but people can not
                    afford to live based on their present incomes.

                <Text as="p">Brazil has been stuck in the middle income trap for many decades due to these issues. While
                    they have worked to resolve many of the issues around this trap, there is still more work to be
                    done.

                        once the policy and institutional reforms were implemented, stable gains showed improvement and
                        steady growth for Brazil’s economy.

                    <li role="listitem">Exclusion Trap – Most of Brazil’s population has remained in poverty, while Brazil’s average per
                        capital income continues to rank among the upper-middle income countries. They continue to
                        combat
                        this imbalance by offering improved access to healthcare, more opportunities for financial
                        services
                        help, and better education opportunities (including on-the-job training) for children and

                <ul class="list-disc pl-4" role="list">
                    <li role="listitem">Infrastructure Development and Investment – Brazil has opportunities to invest in their current
                        infrastructure. This would allow for fine tuning of the public and private sectors to allow for
                        better efficiencies.

                    <li role="listitem">Cost of business – Taxes and other bureaucratic requirements make doing business in Brazil
                        difficult
                        and expensive. Brazil has proven that there are many opportunities for improvement within their
                        tax
                        systems to give businesses more opportunities to conduct their businesses efficiently and to pay
                        employees better – salaries and benefits.
                    </li>
                    <li role="listitem">Government Reform – Brazil needs to become more transparent with their taxpayers. The government
                        needs a reliable communication tool (such as a government website) that would regularly post the
                        financial status of various departments of their office. This would include overall government
                        spending, along with broken down on how the government is spending the taxpayer money. This
                        allows
                        for the community to see and then vote accordingly to their own values and beliefs on how the
                        government should be run.
