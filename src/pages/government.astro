                        Brazilâ€™s recent Presidents have not had the best reputation, especially when leaving office.
                        With
                        each of them failing one after the other, the problems in the country worsen, and new ones arise
                        daily.

                        However, Brazilian citizens are looking for a change after the re-election of former president,
                        Luiz
                        Inacio.

                        diminishing the economy.

                            The executive branch of government is headed by the President and administered by the
                            Cabinet of
                            Ministers. These members are appointed by and can be dismissed by the President. The Cabinet
                            consists of the Chief of Staff, Secretary of Government, Institutional Security Cabinet,
                            Central
                            Bank, and 21 Ministries. Cabinet Ministers are responsible for managing specific ministries.
                            They do this by evaluating ministry programs, creating policies, and properly allocating
                            public
                            resources.

                            The legislative branch of government is administered by the National Congress and is
                            responsible
                            for writing and approving new laws. The Federal Senate and the Chamber of Deputies make up
                            the
                            National Congress. The Federal Senate is made up of 81 members, 3 representatives from each
                            of
                            the states and federal districts. Elections are alternated so one-third of the members are
                            elected after a 4 year period and the other two-thirds are elected after the next 4 years.
                            Each
                            senator serves an 8-year elected term. The Chamber of Deputies consists of 513 members, who
                            are
                            elected based on the population size of their specific state or federal district. These
                            individuals serve 4-year elected terms.

                        <Text as="p">The judicial branch of government is designed based on a civil law adversarial
                            system,
                            which means that cases are tried before a jury. The courts are divided into different
                            jurisdictions throughout state and federal governments with some specially designated
                            courts,
                            including: Labor Justice, Electoral Justice, and Military Justice. The two highest level
                            courts
                            are: the Superior Justice Tribunal and the Supreme Federal Court. The Superior Justice
                            Tribunal
                            hears cases when two or more Federal Regional Tribunals have ruled differently on the same
                            federal laws or when a Federal Regional Tribunal rules in violation of a federal law. The
                            Supreme Federal Court hears cases when a Federal Regional Tribunal rules in violation of the
                            Constitution.
