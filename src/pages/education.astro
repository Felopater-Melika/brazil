            <h2 class="mt-3">Brazilian Education System</h2>
            <p>Brazil according to 2022 review, has a decentralized education system, with education being the
                responsibility of both the federal government and individual states and municipalities. Portuguese is
                the primary language of instruction in Brazilian schools. The system is divided into three main levels:
                early childhood education, basic education (comprising primary and secondary education), and higher
                education. </p>
            <p>Basic education in Brazil is compulsory and free for children aged 4 to 17. The Brazilian curriculum
                typically consists of subjects like mathematics, Portuguese, history, geography, and science. One of the
                major challenges in the Brazilian education system has been the quality of basic education, access to
                education, and significant disparities in the quality of education between different regions.</p>
            <p>Higher Education system in Brazil is diverse across both public and private institutions. The country has
                several world-renowned universities, including the University of São Paulo (USP) and the University of
                Campinas (UNICAMP). The admission process for higher education often involves a standardized exam known
                as the "ENEM" (Exame Nacional do Ensino Médio). Socioeconomic disparities are also in the Brazilian
                higher education system. There are inequalities in access to quality education, with students in more
                affluent areas having better educational opportunities and adequate funding for public schools has been
                a long-standing issue, leading to inadequate infrastructure and resources in the education sector.</p>

            <p>Brazil: public spending in education as share of GDP 2017, by level Published by Statista Research
                Department, Nov 3, 2023</p>
            <p>The Brazilian national government's spending in education amounted to approximately 6.3 percent of the
                country's gross domestic product in 2017.
                Most of the expenditure was destined to basic education, level in which the value invested by the
                government accounted for 4.8 percent of Brazil's GDP.
                In total, public spending in primary education represented three percent of the country's GDP.</p>

                        <p style="color: #fff;">For improvement in the quality of education, teachers must be
                            well-trained and motivated to do their jobs. The Brazilian government must reform the
                            curriculum and other initiatives to better prepare students for the workforce.</p>
                        <p style="color: #fff;">The government has launched initiatives such as "Mais Educação" (More
                            Education) to improve the quality of education and reduce drop-out rates. The federal
                            government has also established the "FIES" program, which provides loans to help students
                            finance their higher education.</p>
